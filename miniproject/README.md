The project utilizes R for data analysis and modeling, and LaTeX for documenting the research findings
Repository Structure
    code/: Contains R script and Latex document.
    data/: Contains the datasets used in the analysis.
    results/: Stores the output of the analysis, including model comparison results and figures.
    
Tools and Packages Used
Here is an overview of the key tools used and their purposes:
R Packages
    readr
        Purpose: Used for efficiently reading and writing data in various formats.
        Note: Ensure data formats are compatible with the functions used for reading (e.g., CSV, TSV).
    minpack.lm
        Purpose: Provides a robust method for non-linear least squares fitting, essential for fitting logistic and Gompertz models.
        Note: Requires initial parameter values for fitting; sensitive to these starting values.
    dplyr
        Purpose: Facilitates data manipulation and cleaning, such as filtering, selecting, and mutating data frames.
        Note: Be familiar with dplyr's syntax for efficient data manipulation.
    ggplot2
        Purpose: Utilized for data visualization and creating complex plots.
        Note: Familiarity with ggplot2 layers and aesthetics is crucial for creating custom plots.

LaTeX for Documentation
    Purpose: LaTeX is used for preparing the research document, ensuring a professional layout and structure.
Get the results first, and then run this Latex file. Since this file needs the output figures. Due to technique problem, pease press enter in the codes when there is lines dislocation.

Running the Analysis
    Execute the R scripts to perform data processing, analysis, and model fitting.
    Compile the LaTeX document to produce the final formatted report.
