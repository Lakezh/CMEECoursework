code:
1. align_seqs_better.py
This script is designed to find the longest matching sequence between two DNA sequences provided in separate files. And it can manage different number of arguments.
2. align_seqs_fasta.py
This script is designed to find the longest matching sequence between two DNA sequences provided in separate FASTA files and outputs the best alignment and score to a text file. It can manage different number of arguments.
3. get_TreeHeight.py
This Python script calculates the height of trees given measurements of the angle of elevation to the top of the tree and the distance from the base of the tree. This script can take data file as an input.
4. get_TreeHeight.R
It is a R version of /get_TreeHeight.py.
5. oaks_debugme.py
It is a modeified script designed to identify oak species (genus 'Quercus') from a list of various tree species.
6. PP_Regress_loc.R
This R script is developed for analyzing predator-prey body mass distributions, specifically focusing on linear regression modeling.
7. run_get_TreeHeight.sh
This Bash script is designed to automate the execution of both R and Python scripts (get_TreeHeight.R and get_TreeHeight.py) that calculate tree heights.
8. TAutoCorr.R
This R script is designed to analyze the autocorrelation of annual mean temperatures at a specific location, determining whether the temperature in one year is significantly related to the temperature in the following year
9. TAutoCorr.tex
This LaTeX document presents the results of the temperature autocorrelation analysis performed by the TAutoCorr.R script

data:
Includes two figure, which is the output of TAutoCorr.R. Other data are from previous parcticals.

results:
All the output results should be put here.
