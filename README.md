MY CMEE Coursework Repository
CMEECoursework repository contains the in-class work and coursework in each weeks. 
There are three directories whcih are week 1 to 3, each contains code, data, results and sandbox.
Code directory is for saving all the code and scripts.
Data directory is for saving all the data used in scripts.
Results directory is for saving all the ouput results of scripts.
Sandbox directory is for experiment and testing codes. 
I put sandbox directoies into gitignore since nothing important in these directories.
